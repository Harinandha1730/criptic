There is no other charity in Australia supporting these people in this way.We surveyed nearly 300 transplant recipients and people with chronic illnesses who told us about their work and study lives. It wasn't sunshine and roses. In fact, some of it was downright heartbreaking - reading that people had been let go because they were "slacking off under the guise of a medical appointment” or being told at an interview "oh, we don't want someone who's always sick here - it'll bring the team down!". In fact, almost 90% of our respondents said that they wouldn't disclose their illness because of what had been said to them in the past.</td>
